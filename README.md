# FoodApp_Jetpackcompose_MVVM
This is a food app that I made to help improve my knowledge of REST, room, and compose skills.

# Introduction
The app displays various meals and their recipes.

# Features
- Search engine for meals.
- Meals can be saved in a favorites section.
- Displays meals worldwide and their recipes.
- Has a category section of meals.

# Getting Started and Usage
The user is greeted with a home screen where the "What do you want to eat?" box displays random meals worldwide. Tapping on any of the random meals takes you to the detail screen, where the area and category of the food are displayed, and tapping on the image of the meal in the detail screen shows the recipe. You can also watch a video of how to prepare it by tapping the YouTube icon. You can save the meal by tapping the favorite button. Also on the home screen is the popular meals box which is supposed to display the popular meals, but the API doesn't allow it with the free plan, so I just displayed the beef category since this is just practice and not a real app. The category section of the home screen displays the various categories of meals, and tapping on any category displays the available meals under that category. The favorites screen in the bottom navigation bar shows saved meals, where one can delete meals by clicking on the icon or swiping left or right, and the category screen displays the categories. Tapping on the search icon in the top right corner of the home screen navigates to the search screen, where a user can search for meals.
